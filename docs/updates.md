# Updates

## Sun, Apr 19

- 🔧 Fixed `--from-json` truncating the description at the first escaped quote. The old parser used `[^"]*` which halted at any `"` character, including an escaped `\"`, so a description like `Log food with "Breakfast" and "Dinner"` got chopped to `Log food with ` and the rest silently vanished. `create --from-json` now hands JSON off to `jq` when it is installed, so escaped quotes, backslashes, and every other JSON escape survive intact. The grep/sed fallback still runs on systems without jq, with the limitation documented inline. Banana pieces reunited 🍌

## Sat, Mar 28

- 🟢 **Fixed CI tests for `submit`** — The `submit` command was `die`-ing when it couldn't detect a GitHub remote or username, even though the workflow was already copied successfully. Now those PR automation failures are warnings, not fatal errors — because the banana is already in the basket, we just couldn't mail it yet! CI goes green for the first time in 5 commits 🍌

## Fri, Mar 28

- 📋 **Post-update release notes** — `clawflows update` now shows you what's new! After pulling the latest, it diffs `docs/updates.md` and prints any new entries right in your terminal. No more updating blindly — now you know exactly which bananas just landed in the basket! 🍌
- 🔌 **Service dependency prompt** — After enabling or creating a workflow, your agent now checks what services it needs (email, calendar, messaging, etc.) and tells you if anything's missing. Essential services get a "you need this" with setup help; optional ones get a "works without it, but better with it" nudge. No more enabling check-email and wondering why the banana can't find your inbox! 🍌
- 🧹 **Cleaned up leftover `requires` fields** — 6 community workflows (audit-subscriptions, check-deep-work, build-trip-prep, check-flight-status, send-call-prep, track-nutrition) still had the `requires` frontmatter field that was removed back on Mar 19. The stragglers have been peeled! 🍌
- 🐛 **New submit-clawflows-issue workflow** — Your agent can now file GitHub issues on ClawFlows when it hits a bug or has an idea. Gathers context, checks for duplicates, and submits via `gh`. The bananas are finally reporting their own bruises! Thanks to [@intenex](https://github.com/intenex) for the idea! 🍌
- 🔧 **Fixed curl-pipe install for agents** — Wrapped the installer in a `main()` function and added `</dev/null` to git commands so `curl | bash` can't get its stdin eaten mid-script. No more mysterious missing symlinks when your agent installs ClawFlows — the whole banana gets downloaded before anyone takes a bite! 🍌
- 🎯 **Quoted emoji in frontmatter** — All `emoji:` values in WORKFLOW.md files are now wrapped in quotes so GitHub stops showing that angry red YAML error banner. The CLI already stripped quotes on read, so nothing changes for users — just GitHub being picky about its bananas! Thanks to [@justinhuangcode](https://github.com/justinhuangcode) for spotting it 🍌
- 🧪 **Dashboard test cleanup fix** — Dashboard server tests now properly kill child node processes on teardown using process groups, so tests don't hang from orphaned servers piling up like uneaten bananas 🍌
- 📥 **Import command** — `clawflows import <url>` lets you install any workflow from a URL. Supports GitHub raw URLs, blob URLs (auto-converts), and gists. Download, validate, save to custom, done. The sharing banana just got way more portable! Thanks to [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn) for the contribution! 🍌

## Tue, Mar 25

- 🔒 **Path traversal protection** — Workflow names now go through a strict bouncer: letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores only. No more sneaky `../../` trying to escape the banana stand! Every command that accepts a name gets checked, so your filesystem stays safe from rogue traversals. Thanks to [@TerminalsandCoffee](https://github.com/TerminalsandCoffee) for the security report and [@hnshah](https://github.com/hnshah) for the fix! 🍌

## Thu, Mar 20

- 🐛 **Essentials Pack actually enables now** — The installer was checking `workflows/available/` instead of `workflows/available/community/`, so the 4 essentials never actually got enabled. The banana was in the wrong basket this whole time! 🍌
- ✨ **Try-it-now suggests morning inspiration** — Changed the post-install "Try It Now" suggestion from `check-calendar` to `send-morning-inspiration` — works without any services configured, so new users get instant gratification! 🍌
- 💬 **Friendlier enable messages** — `clawflows enable` now shows the emoji, description, and schedule instead of debug-style output. You'll know exactly what you just turned on and when it runs! 🍌
- 🖥️ **Dashboard in post-install** — The "Try It Now" section now suggests `clawflows dashboard` first so new users can browse everything visually.
- 📧 **New check-email workflow** — A read-only inbox summary that categorizes your emails and shows what matters — no sneaky unsubscribing or archiving behind your back! Think of it as a banana you can look at but not peel 🍌
- 🔄 **Safer essentials pack** — Swapped `process-email` for `check-email` in the Essentials Pack. New users get a gentle inbox overview instead of auto-unsubscribing from day one. You can always enable `process-email` later when you're ready to let the minion loose on your inbox!
- 🚀 **Post-install try-it-now** — After installing, you now get a friendly nudge to run your first workflow right away. One command, instant banana gratification 🍌

## Wed, Mar 19

- 🧹 **Removed `requires` field** — The `requires` frontmatter field never got used by a single workflow or the CLI, so we yeeted it. Workflows just describe what they need in plain text and the agent figures it out — no need for a formal dependency spec. One less thing to think about when creating a workflow, one more banana for simplicity! 🍌

## Sun, Mar 8

- 📜 **Run logs** — `clawflows run` now captures agent output automatically, so you can see exactly what happened! `clawflows logs` shows your recent runs with their output, filter by workflow name or date. The dashboard shows log previews in Run History and expandable logs in the detail panel. No more "did it run?" guessing — every banana leaves a trail now 🍌

## Fri, Mar 7

- 📤 **Share a single workflow** — `clawflows share <name>` generates shareable text with the workflow's emoji, name, description, and a one-liner install+enable command. Add `--copy` to yeet it straight to your clipboard. The dashboard detail panel also has a shiny Share button that renders a shareable image card, lets you download it, copy the text, or post on X. One banana at a time, shared with the world! 🍌

## Mon, Feb 24

- 📊 **Run history in the dashboard** — The dashboard now has a Run History tab showing when your workflows actually ran! See all runs grouped by date (newest first), click any to open the workflow detail panel, and each workflow's panel now shows its 5 most recent runs. It's like a banana-flavored activity feed for your workflows 🍌
- 🧠 **Agent knows create auto-enables** — The agent-facing instructions now explicitly say that `clawflows create` auto-enables the workflow and syncs AGENTS.md. No more "let me enable that for you" after creating — the banana was already in the basket! 🍌
- 🔔 **No more double reminders** — Scheduled workflows were firing twice because the scheduler saved run markers using the current time instead of the scheduled time. Two consecutive 15-min checks would both think the workflow hadn't run yet. Now the marker is always keyed to the scheduled time — one banana per time slot, no duplicates! 🍌

## Sun, Feb 22

- 🌐 **Live dashboard** — `clawflows dashboard` now starts a local server so you can enable and disable workflows right from your browser — no more copying CLI commands! Click the toggle, watch it flip, done. It's like having a banana-powered control panel 🍌
- ⚡ **9x faster dashboard** — Dashboard JSON generation went from 5.2s to 0.6s by replacing ~550 subprocess spawns with a single awk pass. Your banana-powered control panel now loads before you can peel one 🍌
- 🚀 **Instant enable/disable** — Toggling workflows and creating new ones now update the UI instantly with optimistic rendering. The server syncs in the background while you admire your freshly toggled banana.
- 🍌 **Custom vs Community in list** — `clawflows list` now separates your custom workflows from community ones! Your bananas go in one basket, the community's in another. No more guessing which workflows are yours.
- 🔗 **Fixed rogue workflow creation** — The creating-workflows guide was telling agents to drop workflows straight into `workflows/enabled/` like a banana without a peel. Now it correctly says to use `clawflows create`, which puts them in `custom/` and symlinks them like a civilized minion.

## Thu, Feb 19

- 🍌 **Generic nudge in create** — The interactive `clawflows create` prompt now gently reminds you to keep it generic — say "the user" not your name, skip the hardcoded locations. Your workflows should work for any banana-loving human, not just you!

## Wed, Feb 18

- 🧙 **Interactive workflow creation** — Agents now walk you through questions before creating a workflow, show you the result, and ask if you want tweaks — no more yolo JSON dumps! The creating-workflows guide is the single source of truth, and `_build_block()` tells the agent to read it first. One file to rule them all, one file to find them!

## Tue, Feb 17

- 📖 **Workflow creation guide link** — The agent now knows about `docs/creating-workflows.md` when creating clawflows — no more guessing, just follow the banana-scented blueprint!
- 🤖 **Agent-friendly installer** — Added clear explanations throughout `install.sh` so AI agents stop freaking out about cron jobs and PATH changes. Installer now detects no terminal (agent context) and skips interactive prompts — the agent handles backup restore and essentials conversationally instead of silently auto-accepting. Humans still get the same interactive experience!
- 🍌 **Generic workflows** — Workflows are now written so ANY human can use them — no more hardcoded names, cities, or banana preferences.
- 🧠 **Live updates** — After `clawflows update`, the agent re-reads AGENTS.md so it picks up new instructions mid-conversation.
- 🗣️ **New trigger phrases** — Say "make a clawflow", "let's make a workflow", whatever feels natural — your agent gets it now.
